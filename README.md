Expense Tracker
----------------


Project Title & Description-
---------------------------

Expense Tracker is a DOM-based web application built using HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript.
The application allows users to add, view, and delete expenses while dynamically updating the total expense amount and monthly summary.
All updates happen in real time without page reload, making the application interactive and user-friendly.



Problem Statement-
-----------------

Keeping track of daily expenses manually can be confusing and time-consuming.
This project aims to provide a simple solution where users can record their expenses, view total spending for the current month, and manage their data easily using a browser-based application.



Features Implemented-
--------------------

Add new expenses dynamically using a form

Delete individual expenses from the list

Automatically calculate and update total expenses

Monthly summary showing total amount and number of expenses

Input validation for expense name and amount

Expense amount allowed only in multiples of ₹10

Data persistence using browser LocalStorage

Empty state message when no expenses are added



DOM Concepts Used-
------------------

Dynamic creation and removal of DOM elements

Updating the DOM based on user interaction

Event handling for form submission and button clicks

Event delegation for delete functionality

Conditional rendering of UI elements

Manipulating text content and styles using JavaScript




Steps to Run the Project-
-------------------------

Download or clone the project repository

Open the index.html file in any modern web browser

No additional setup or installation is required




Known Limitations-
-----------------

All expenses are assumed to belong to the current month

No category-wise filtering of expenses

No backend or server-side data storage

No user authentication

These limitations were intentionally kept to focus on core JavaScript and DOM concepts.
